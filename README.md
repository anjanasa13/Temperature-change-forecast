Forecasting Temperature Change in India: A Comparative Study of SARIMA and LSTM Models

# Title: Forecasting Temperature Change in India: A Comparative Study of SARIMA and LSTM Models

# Description:
This project aims to forecast temperature changes in India using time series forecasting models, specifically SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models. The data utilized for this analysis is sourced from the FAOSTAT Temperature Change sector, which provides comprehensive statistics on average surface temperature variations per country. The dataset covers the period from 1961 to 2019 and includes monthly, seasonal, and annual temperature anomalies, relative to a baseline climatology from 1951 to 1980. Additionally, the dataset provides information on the standard deviation of temperature changes based on this baseline methodology. The data is obtained from the publicly accessible GISTEMP dataset, distributed by NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (NASA-GISS).

# The project involves several key steps:
1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and prepared for analysis, including handling missing values, data transformation, and feature engineering.
2. Model Training: SARIMA and LSTM models are trained using historical temperature data for various months in India.
3. Model Evaluation: The accuracy of the trained models is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
4. Forecasting: The trained models are used to forecast future temperature changes for each month in India.
5. Comparative Analysis: The forecasts generated by SARIMA and LSTM models are compared to identify the model that provides more accurate predictions.

By leveraging advanced time series forecasting techniques, this project aims to provide valuable insights into the future temperature trends in India. These insights can be utilized by policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders to develop effective climate resilience strategies and sustainable development plans for the region.
